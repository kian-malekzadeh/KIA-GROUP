/**
 * KIA GROUP domain events (in-process bus).
 *
 * Departments communicate through events instead of importing each other's
 * services. The bus is intentionally simple: a typed publish/subscribe registry
 * owned by the platform (`common/`), with a built-in structured-log consumer so
 * every emission is observable in production today, and a documented growth
 * path to persistent outbox / notification-center consumers when scale needs it.
 *
 * Contract rules:
 *  - Event names are `<domain>.<entity>.<happened>` and are part of the
 *    platform contract — renaming one is a breaking change for every consumer.
 *  - Payloads carry IDs and timestamps only. Never put secrets, tokens or PII
 *    beyond the actor id into a payload: events are logged.
 *  - `publish` never throws into the emitting business flow — a broken
 *    consumer must not fail the transaction that produced the event.
 *  - Consumers must be idempotent: at-least-once delivery is the contract.
