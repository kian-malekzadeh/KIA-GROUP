/**
 * Department taxonomy for the KIA GROUP authorization model.
 *
 * The platform has one identity per user and six departments. This module is
 * the canonical vocabulary for department-scoped roles (so every department —
 * and every future department app — spells its roles the same way and reads
 * them from one place instead of scattering string literals).
 *
 * STATUS: vocabulary + helpers. Department memberships are not persisted yet
 * (the platform has no per-department membership table; the current
 * authorization surface is the platform roles above plus the moderator access
 * matrix in `admin-access.ts`). When department membership lands, its storage
 * MUST key departments by these slugs and roles by these keys — do not invent
 * a second vocabulary.
