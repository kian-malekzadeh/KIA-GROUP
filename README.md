Kia Group is a production-grade platform for Iranian talent, built around six
departments: KIA Academy (learning), KIA Work (freelancing and hiring), KIA Material
(design assets), KIA Event (contests, bootcamps, webinars), KIA Community (people)
and KIA Lab (research and product).
Guests land on a minimal Persian hero, explore **Material Studio**, then follow a guided
journey: phone OTP → profile → free goal assessment → free readiness test → personalized
roadmap → paid bundle checkout → lesson player. The learner experience is entirely
**فارسی / RTL**; staff sign in with email + password and manage everything from a
role-scoped admin panel.

> 💡 The live demo runs in **in-browser demo mode** (`NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true`): the
> full UI works against mock data with zero backend required — perfect for exploring the
> product before self-hosting. Hosted at <https://kia-academy.dashploy.app> (DashPloy,
> static tier).

## ✨ Highlights

| 🇮🇷 **Persian-first UX** | Full-fa RTL UI, Iranian phone OTP signup, province/city picker, prices shown in تومان over IRR storage |
| 🧭 **Adaptive engine** | Goal assessment → readiness exam grading → per-track roadmap with module levels |
| 🎓 **Lesson player** | Markdown lessons, video, notes and an HTML/CSS/JS playground |
| 👛 **Learner panel** | Wallet, orders/invoices, exams, courses, bootcamp rank, todos, tickets, messages, profile |
| 🛡️ **Admin governance** | `SUPER_ADMIN` vs matrix-limited `ADMIN` permissions, editable test banks, site settings catalog |
| 🔍 **SEO-ready** | Dynamic sitemap/robots, JSON-LD, canonical URLs, OG/Twitter cards, noindex on private routes |

## 📐 Architecture

KIA GROUP is a **modular monolith in a pnpm monorepo**: the parent platform owns
identity, navigation, permissions, search, commerce and settings; the six
departments are independent business domains that share the platform instead of
each other.

### The seven brands

| Brand | Colour | Token | Department code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| KIA GROUP | `#FFC864` | `--group-gold` (reserved) | platform |
| KIA Academy | `#6464FF` | `--dept-academy` | `kia-group/kia-academy/` · `app/(academy)` |
| KIA Work | `#6492FF` | `--dept-work` | `kia-group/kia-work/` (scaffold) · `app/(work)` → `/freelance` |
| KIA Material | `#148165` | `--dept-material` | `kia-group/kia-material/` (Material Studio) · `app/(material)` |
| KIA Lab | `#28C793` | `--dept-labs` | `kia-group/kia-lab/` (scaffold) · `app/(labs)` |
| KIA Event | `#E32B1B` | `--dept-events` | `kia-group/kia-event/` · `app/(events)` |
| KIA Community | `#FF7344` | `--dept-community` | `kia-group/kia-community/` (scaffold) · `app/(community)` |

Colours are defined **once** in [`packages/brand`](packages/brand) and pinned by
tests on both sides (TypeScript tokens *and* the stylesheet that consumes them).
On-fill ink is chosen by measured contrast, never by hand.

### Department isolation

- Each department lives in its own workspace package under `kia-group/` (like a
  standalone project): it may depend on `@kia-group/platform` (kernel) and
  `@kia-group/shared`, **never on another department** — enforced by ESLint
  (`no-restricted-imports` in the shared flat config). `apps/api` is the
  connection point that composes the packages in `app.module.ts`.
- Cross-department behaviour goes through shared contracts, the platform
  (search / commerce / identity) or
  **domain events** (`packages/platform/src/common/events` — `group.user.registered`,
  `group.user.profile_completed`, `group.payment.completed`,
  `events.registration.created`, `academy.course.completed`).
- Global search fans out to registered `SearchableProvider`s and tags every hit
  with its source department (`GET /api/search`).
- One identity across all seven brands — see
  [`docs/architecture/authentication.md`](docs/architecture/authentication.md).

**Why one web app instead of seven?** The departments share a learner journey
(OTP → profile → assessment → roadmap → checkout → lesson player) and one
session. Splitting them into seven Next apps would duplicate auth, i18n and the
checkout flow for a separation that route groups + API domains already give
(§34 modular monolith). Extraction to per-department apps remains possible: each
department is already a self-contained package (own routes, API domain,
token and search provider), so extraction stays a matter of unwiring it from
`app.module.ts`.

**Request flow:** Browser → Next.js (`rewrites /api/*`) → NestJS guards chain
(`JwtAuthGuard` → `RolesGuard` → `AdminAccessGuard`) → DTO validation → Prisma →
PostgreSQL. Lesson videos are served through signed authenticated media URLs — never a
public static dump.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Node **≥ 22.13**, pnpm via Corepack, PostgreSQL 16 (local or Docker).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kian-malekzadeh/KIA-GROUP.git KIA-GROUP
cd KIA-GROUP

corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@11.19.0 --activate
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile        # also generates the Prisma client

# environment templates (git-ignored)
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env          # set DATABASE_URL + JWT secrets
cp apps/group/.env.example apps/group/.env.local    # leave NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE unset for real API

pnpm docker:db                        # or run your own Postgres 16
pnpm --filter @kia-group/shared build
pnpm db:migrate                       # applies all 19 migrations (baseline + hardening)
pnpm db:seed                          # catalog + banks + starter users

pnpm dev                              # web :3000 · api :3001 · health /api/health
```

> 🔐 Development seeding creates starter accounts (including admin & learner) for local
> testing only. **No real credentials are ever committed** — production passwords are
> generated at deploy time and rotated; see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

> Playwright one-time setup for e2e:
> `pnpm --filter @kia-group/group exec playwright install chromium`

### Run modes

| Mode | Command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A — Local Postgres | steps above with your own DB URL | no Docker needed |
| B — Docker Postgres only | `pnpm docker:db` then `pnpm dev` | hot-reload DX (recommended) |
| C — Full Docker stack | `pnpm docker:setup && pnpm docker:up` | production-like containers |
| D — Static Pages export | `pnpm build:pages` | demo mode, basePath `/KIA-GROUP` (override with `PAGES_REPO_NAME`) |

## 🧰 Scripts

| Root script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | Web + API concurrently (hot reload) |
| `pnpm build` | libs (permissions → brand → shared) → api → web (ordered automatically) |
| `pnpm build:libs` | Workspace libraries only (required before api/web) |
| `pnpm lint` / `pnpm typecheck` | ESLint flat config / tsc project references |
| `pnpm test` | Jest (api) + Vitest (shared, brand, permissions, web) suites |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | Playwright end-to-end flows |
| `pnpm build:pages` | Static GitHub Pages demo export (basePath `/KIA-GROUP`) |
| `pnpm db:migrate` / `db:migrate:deploy` | Dev migrate / non-interactive apply |
| `pnpm db:seed` | Idempotent upserts (catalog, banks, settings, starter users)
| `pnpm docker:*` | db/db:down/db:reset/setup/up/down/logs/build |

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Everything ships as templates — only `*.example` files are committed.

| Variable | Where | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | api `.env` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` / `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` | api `.env` | ≥32 chars; weak values rejected in production by Joi schema |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | api `.env` | Public web origin, credential-safe single origin |
| `OTP_DEV_EXPOSE` | api `.env` | ⚠️ dev-only flag returning `devCode`; must stay unset in production |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` / `API_PROXY_TARGET` | web `.env.local` | Same-origin proxy in local/Docker; external origin on static hosting |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE` | web `.env.local` | `true` → fully in-browser mock API (static hosting: Pages/DashPloy), no backend needed |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, SMTP_* | api `.env` | Optional providers (IRR gateways ZarinPal/IDPay supported natively) |

## 🧪 Quality Gates

- ✅ ESLint + `tsc --noEmit` across all workspaces
- ✅ 367 unit/API tests — Jest API suite (auth, payments, guards, competitions…) + Vitest suites (brand, permissions, shared, web)
- ✅ CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) boots a real Postgres service → migrate → seed → lint → typecheck → test → build on every push/PR to `main`
- ✅ E2E (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`) runs the 9-flow Playwright learner journey against a production build + real Postgres
- ✅ Security (`.github/workflows/security.yml`) — blocking `pnpm audit` on prod deps (**0 vulnerabilities**), gitleaks secret scan, CodeQL SAST (push + weekly sweep)
- ✅ Dependabot weekly dependency, action & Docker updates

## 🛡️ Security Posture

| Control | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| AuthN/AuthZ | Short-lived access JWT + revocable refresh cookie, each with an independent rotating secret; bcrypt-hashed credentials |
| Rate limiting | Enforced per-route limits on auth/OTP/global traffic to slow credential abuse |
| Headers | Helmet (api) + full security headers incl. CSP/HSTS/XFO on Next responses |
| Validation | class-validator whitelist + forbidNonWhitelisted; Joi env schema at boot |
| Uploads | MIME allow-lists, size caps, safe-path helper, authenticated media URLs |
| Payment integrity | In-app free confirmation blocked in production; gateway callbacks verify through provider APIs |
| Dependencies | pnpm workspace `overrides` pin patched transitive versions; CI blocks on high+ prod advisories (currently 0) |

Report vulnerabilities responsibly per [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) — please use private advisories instead of public issues.

## ☁️ Deployment

- **DashPloy (primary demo):** the live demo is published as a static site at
  <https://kia-academy.dashploy.app> (free static tier, `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true`,
  no backend). To redeploy, build with `GITHUB_PAGES=true NEXT_BASE_PATH= NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true pnpm --filter @kia-group/group build`,
  then push `apps/group/out` via the DashPloy API (`POST /api/v1/deploy`, see
  <https://dashploy.com/llms.txt>).
- **GitHub Pages (mirror):** the `Deploy GitHub Pages` workflow builds the demo app on every push to `main` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true`, basePath `/KIA-GROUP/`, taken from the repository name via `PAGES_REPO_NAME`) and deploys it automatically — live at <https://kian-malekzadeh.github.io/KIA-GROUP/>. Local preview: `pnpm build:pages` → serve `apps/group/out`.
- **Self-host Docker:** hardened multi-stage images (`docker build --target api|web`) running as a non-root `node` user, OCI-labelled, with built-in healthchecks; Compose adds `init: true` and `no-new-privileges` on app containers. See run mode **C** above.
- **CI:** every commit is validated against a live Postgres before merge
